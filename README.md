# GIdisk2obs2023
Fitting a parametrized model of gravitationally self-regulated disks to dust continuum images (Xu et al. 2023, https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01972)

This is an updated version of the GIdisk2obs code (Xu 2022) which includes several new features. Because many of the changes are not backward-compatible, I'm placing this code in a new repository.

## Using the disk model
See example_disk_model.ipynb for an example of using the model to calculate the radial profile of the disk.

## Comparing against observation and fitting the model
See TMC1A_fitting.py and example_fit.ipynb for an example of fitting the model to multi-wavelength observation. You won't be able to run this notebook because the disk images (fits files), which I do not own, are not included in this repository. But the code should (hopefully) be self-explanatory.
